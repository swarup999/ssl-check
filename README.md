# ssl-check


Here's a Python script that uses the ssl and socket libraries to check SSL certificates for specified websites. It takes a list of website names and port numbers, connects to each one, and extracts the expiration date of the SSL certificate. Finally, it generates a report table that includes the website name, SSL status, expiration date, and days remaining until expiration.
